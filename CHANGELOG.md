## [Unreleased] - 2024-XX-XX

### Security Enhancements üîí
- **Strengthened affiliation validation flow** - Centralized validation logic using `secure-affiliation-check` function
- **Enhanced password policy** - Now requires minimum 8 characters, at least one uppercase letter and one number
- **Improved rate limiting** - Implemented 10 requests per 5 minutes per client with proper cooldown handling
- **Added audit logging** - All affiliation validation attempts are now logged with anonymized client IDs
- **Removed hardcoded credentials** - Moved sensitive configuration to environment variables

### Backend Improvements üîß
- **Exness client robustness** - Added exponential backoff retry logic, proper timeout handling (10s), and comprehensive error handling
- **Unified error responses** - Consistent JSON response structure across all validation endpoints
- **Token caching optimization** - Smart token expiry handling based on actual API response
- **Function consolidation** - Deprecated `validate-affiliation` in favor of `secure-affiliation-check` with backward compatibility wrapper

### Frontend Enhancements üí°
- **Unified validation hook** - Single `useAffiliationValidation` hook for all affiliation checks
- **Structured error handling** - Error handling based on response structure rather than string parsing
- **Improved UX feedback** - Better loading states, cooldown timers, and user-friendly error messages
- **Cleaned demo artifacts** - Removed development/testing comments from production UI

### Developer Experience üõ†Ô∏è
- **Comprehensive test suite** - Added unit tests for password validation, Exness client, and affiliation hook
- **Environment variable management** - Clear separation between client and server-side configuration
- **Updated documentation** - Enhanced `.env.example` with proper categorization and security notes
- **Feature flag protection** - All new functionality respects existing feature flag system

### Migration Notes üìã
- **Environment Variables**: Update your environment configuration based on the new `.env.example`
- **API Changes**: The validation responses now use structured format (`is_affiliated`, `uid`, `error` fields)
- **Backward Compatibility**: Existing `validate-affiliation` calls will continue to work via compatibility wrapper
- **Feature Flags**: With flags disabled, the application maintains current behavior

### Breaking Changes ‚ö†Ô∏è
- Password validation now enforces stronger requirements (8+ characters, uppercase, number)
- Validation API responses use new structured format (though wrapper maintains compatibility)

### Testing üß™
- Added comprehensive test coverage for critical authentication flows
- Tests verify rate limiting, retry logic, timeout handling, and error scenarios
- Password validation test suite ensures security policy compliance
