## [Unreleased]

### Added (Flagged Features - OFF by default)
- **Feature Flags System** (`src/lib/flags.ts`) - Complete feature flag system supporting:
  - `academy_v1` - Academia module infrastructure
  - `signals_v1` - Trading signals module infrastructure  
  - `copy_v1` - Copy trading module infrastructure
  - `rbac_v1` - Advanced Role-Based Access Control
  - `obs_v1` - Observability and metrics system
  - `api_v1` - New versioned API endpoints
- **Academy Module Structure** (`src/modules/academy/`) - Complete type definitions and mock data for:
  - Course management with video, text, quiz, and exercise content
  - Student progress tracking and completion metrics
  - Academy statistics and analytics
- **Signals Module Structure** (`src/modules/signals/`) - Trading signals infrastructure with:
  - Signal providers and subscription management
  - Performance tracking and accuracy metrics
  - Real-time notifications system
- **Copy Trading Module Structure** (`src/modules/copy/`) - Copy trading system with:
  - Trader profiles and performance metrics
  - Position copying with risk management
  - Follower statistics and commission tracking
- **Observability System** (`src/lib/observability.ts`) - Comprehensive logging and metrics:
  - Structured logging with multiple levels
  - Performance monitoring and timing
  - API request/response logging
  - React component performance hooks
- **New API Endpoints** (Supabase Edge Functions):
  - `/api/v1/health` - System health checks and monitoring
  - `/api/v1/affiliation/validate` - Enhanced affiliation validation with security
- **Smoke Tests** (`src/__tests__/smoke.test.tsx`) - Critical flow validation:
  - Landing page rendering without errors
  - Onboarding flow basic functionality
  - Dashboard navigation testing
  - Feature flag integration testing
  - Mock API response handling

### Changed (Internal - No User Impact)
- **Environment Configuration** - Migrated hardcoded constants to environment variables:
  - `PARTNER_ID` now reads from `VITE_PARTNER_ID` (maintains same visible value)
  - `PARTNER_LINK` now reads from `VITE_PARTNER_LINK` (maintains same behavior)
  - `EXNESS_AUTH_URL` and `EXNESS_AFFILIATION_URL` now configurable
  - Backwards compatible - existing imports still work unchanged
- **Constants Migration** (`src/lib/constants.ts`) - Added environment variable support with fallbacks
- **Build System** - Added new NPM scripts for enhanced development workflow:
  - `test:smoke` - Run smoke tests for critical flows
  - `lint:ci` - CI-friendly linting with JSON output
  - `typecheck` - TypeScript compilation checking

### Security
- **Rate Limiting** - Implemented in new API endpoints (10 req/min per client)
- **Request Timeouts** - 8-second timeouts with AbortController
- **Input Validation** - Enhanced email validation and sanitization
- **Error Handling** - Structured error responses without exposing internals
- **CORS Security** - Proper CORS headers for all new endpoints
- **Secrets Management** - Environment-based configuration for sensitive data

### Tests
- **Smoke Test Coverage** - Critical user flows protected by automated tests
- **Mock API Testing** - All response codes (200/401/429/400/500) validated
- **Performance Baselines** - Render time testing for key components
- **Feature Flag Testing** - Validation of flag behavior in various states

### Documentation
- **NO-BREAK GUARDRAILS** (`docs/NO-BREAK-GUARDRAILS.md`) - Comprehensive safety documentation:
  - Risk matrix and mitigation strategies
  - Feature flag configuration and rollback procedures
  - Release and rollback checklists
  - Protected contracts and emergency procedures
- **Environment Setup** (`.env.example`) - Complete environment configuration template
- **Code Documentation** - Extensive inline documentation for all new modules

## Important Notes

### Backwards Compatibility
- **100% Backwards Compatible** - All existing functionality unchanged
- **Zero Breaking Changes** - Existing API contracts maintained exactly
- **Feature Flags OFF** - All new features disabled by default
- **Same User Experience** - No visible changes to end users

### Migration Path
- Environment variables are **optional** - fallbacks maintain existing behavior
- Feature flags are **opt-in** - enable only when ready for testing
- New APIs are **parallel** - existing endpoints unchanged
- Module structures are **prepared** - not connected to UI until flagged

### Security Posture
- No secrets exposed in client bundle
- Enhanced error handling without information disclosure
- Rate limiting and timeout protection
- Comprehensive audit trail for security events

### Testing Strategy
- **Smoke tests MUST pass** before any deployment
- **Contract tests** validate API compatibility
- **Performance baselines** ensure no degradation
- **Feature flag isolation** prevents accidental activation

---

**DEPLOYMENT SAFETY:** With all flags OFF, this release is functionally identical to the previous version. New capabilities can be enabled gradually through feature flags.
